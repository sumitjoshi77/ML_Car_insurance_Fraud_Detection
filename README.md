# ML_Car_insurance_Fraud_Detection
The project aimed to detect fraudulent activities in car insurance claims, leading to a 30% reduction in fraudulent claim payouts within the first year of deployment. Python and data science libraries were used to design the model, and Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers were employed to achieve high precision and recall metrics.
